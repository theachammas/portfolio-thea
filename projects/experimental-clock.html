        <p class="project-description">Ever since I was a kid, my mood, sleep cycles and energy level were irregular in a way I couldn't comprehend, until my mum some day told me after I suffered from an insomnia "it's because yesterday was a full moon". She turned out to be right. Every time I suffered from insomnia and would check the moon cycle, it was a full moon.</p>
